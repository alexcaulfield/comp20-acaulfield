# notuber implementation Alex Caulfield

The application shows the current location as a stick figure ![Image of stick figure](stick-fig.png) with a username in the marker, along with available transport vehicles with car symbols ![Image of car](black-car.png) if it is a passenger, or passengers in need of a pickup ![Image of passenger](passenger.png) if it is a driver. Each marker shows a username and distance from the current location (stick figure) when clicked on.

To run this program, simply serve with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

### Correctly Implemented
I believe every part of the assignment is implemented to the best of my knowledge. I do not like my implementation to determine whether or not to display passengers or vehicles, and would like to know a better way to modularize the code.
