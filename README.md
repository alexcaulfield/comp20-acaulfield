# Alex Caulfield comp20 repository

### What is this purpose of this Git repository?
To show my work in comp20 and how I have grown as a web programmer over the semester.

### What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
As much as a lot of it felt like a pain, I really enjoyed assignment 3 because I got to fully understand how a full stack web application works (at a really low level). The picture that was drawn on the first day of class of how a web application works was way over my head, but digging in and building a server and storing information in a database gives me an idea of how the web apps that I use on a daily basis actually function.

### How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
Hard to quantify this, but a lot? I think it comes back to learning the front end and then being able to connect the back end. Understanding how a web application works and what goes on when you type something into a browser seem like the most valuable skills as a web developer, and I now feel somewhat comfortable with explaining both of those things.

### What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
Learning how something gets displayed and functions in a browser is probably the most important thing I learned
* It helped me visualize how all the parts of assignment 3 worked together, from the interaction with assignment 2 to placing a specific document in the database
* I can now look at the console and understand what is being done in my web browser to get the webpage there, which will allow me to look at that and better understand how to develop my own web apps

### Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
I would like to understand asynchronosity and callback functions better. I still don't feel like I have a great grasp on javascript but I do love the simplicity and functionality of it with the backend, even though some may not like it as a programming language. I would like to better understand what lines get run in a javascript function and where to put function calls, along with how to make callback functions that make a web application run faster or smoother.
